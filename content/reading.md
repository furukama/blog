## Recently Finished

{{< booklist title="Polostan" author="Neal Stephenson" date="June 2025" url="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/199793426" rating="3.88" notes="Feels like a long first chapter to a very long novel. Has some moments, but didn't really catch me. I'll probably read the second part of the series anyway. (2/5)" >}}

{{< booklist title="Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI" author="Ethan Mollick" date="June 2025" url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198678736-co-intelligence" rating="3.99" notes="Loved this very much. It's the perfect mix of techno-optimism (or techno-letstryitoutism) and care. In a nutshell: our job is to find out what LLMs can do for us, stay in the loop as human, treat them like humans (although knowing they aren't), remember that AI tomorrow will be much better than today. (5/5)" >}}

{{< booklist title="How Big Things Get Done" author="Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner" date="May 2025" url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61327449-how-big-things-get-done" rating="4.29" notes="Lots of anecdotes leave you well prepared for summer party small talk. The Sydney opera house story was fascinating to read. But: lots of words for very simple messages. Do plan. (3/5)" >}}

{{< booklist title="The Sovereign Individual" author="James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg" date="July 2025" url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82256.The_Sovereign_Individual" rating="4.19" notes="What a strange book! Although so many projections came out wrong in the last 25 years, I really enjoyed reading it. Challenging a lot of ideas: Democracy is mainly a way of extracting wealth and building an army. Workers are exploiting capitalists. Violence is no longer a thing... whew. (4/5)" >}}
