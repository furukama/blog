{{< booklist title="Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI" author="Ethan Mollick" date="June 2025" url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198678736-co-intelligence" rating="4.18" notes="Loved this very much. It's the perfect mix of techno-optimism (or techno-letstryitoutism) and care. In a nutshell: our job is to find out what LLMs can do for us, stay in the loop as human, treat them like humans (although knowing they aren't), remember that AI tomorrow will be much better than today. (5/5)" >}}

The Sydney opera house story was fascinating to read. But: lots of words for very simple messages. Do plan. (3/5)" >}}
