## What I'm doing now

*Updated May 29, 2025 from Munich, Germany*

### Reading
- Reading a lot of fascinating books in our book club
- Currently reading: [Co-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198678736-co-intelligence)
- Always looking for recommendations

### Health & Fitness
- Training for the [Centenarian Decathlon](https://peterattiamd.com/how-to-train-for-the-centenarian-decathlon/)
- Rucking and lifing heavy weights

### Technology
- Working with AI Coding Agents
- Exploring how AI is giving software back the magic

### Learning
- Literary Chinese because you never know when this could come handy - using [Vogelsang's](https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/china/personen/vogelsang.html) excellent introduction

### Looking Ahead
- Writing a curriculum for kids in the Age of AGI
- Sociologist by profession - so I can't help to imagine how this changes everything
